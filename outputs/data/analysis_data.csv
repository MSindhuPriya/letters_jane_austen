"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession",,5,12
"of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",,3,11
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his,,8,15
"first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds",,6,13
"of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful",,6,11
property of some one or other of their daughters.,,6,9
"""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard that",,6,15
"Netherfield Park is let at last?""",,4,6
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.,,5,7
"""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she",,8,14
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He,,9,14
"had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his",,3,13
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was,,7,14
"paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following",,6,14
"manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he",,7,11
"suddenly addressed her with,",,4,4
"""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.""",,3,8
"""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her mother",,6,15
"resentfully, ""since we are not to visit.""",,5,7
"""But you forget, mama,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we shall meet him at the",,7,13
"Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five",,8,12
"daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her",,5,12
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him,,4,10
"in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and",,4,9
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at,,9,14
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,,9,11
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been,,5,11
"delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely",,9,10
"agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly",,11,14
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of,,5,13
"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in",,11,13
"her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much",,11,13
she admired him.,,2,3
"""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible, good",,5,14
"humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,",,7,12
"with such perfect good breeding!""",,4,5
"""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man ought",,6,11
"likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""",,9,12
"""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I",,7,15
"did not expect such a compliment.""",,3,6
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets,,4,13
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade,,7,11
"in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the",,10,13
"honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.",,2,12
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a,,6,13
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and,,5,14
"quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a",,5,14
"mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he",,9,11
"could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by",,4,11
"business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For",,5,12
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit,,8,12
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the,,9,13
good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was,,3,13
"found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a",,7,13
"wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the",,9,11
two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest,,10,11
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of,,9,10
"every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;",,10,12
"though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in",,4,15
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was,,5,12
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two,,8,12
"thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in",,5,11
"default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's",,6,12
"fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply",,4,12
"the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and",,9,13
had left her four thousand pounds.,,2,6
"She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their",,7,16
"father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in",,9,12
London in a respectable line of trade.,,5,7
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most,,5,12
"At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six",,6,15
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then,,8,11
"poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the",,6,12
"much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very",,6,13
"favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing",,9,12
"this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how",,11,12
"shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked",,6,13
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their,,9,13
"indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored",,12,9
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.,,7,9
"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the",,9,15
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the,,10,14
"enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,",,10,12
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his,,8,13
"sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a",,11,12
"note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her",,7,13
"own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and",,7,11
"its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her",,6,11
"two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.",,9,10
"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been",,9,13
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss,,6,14
"Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who",,5,12
"continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined",,8,11
"their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.",,7,13
"Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching",,4,12
"the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by",,8,12
"messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and",,7,13
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.,,3,6
"Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in",,8,10
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual,,8,11
"When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,",,11,12
"and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the",,9,11
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many,,7,12
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable,,13,11
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.,,13,12
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an,,10,10
"entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh",,7,10
at their acquaintance with spirit.,,2,5
"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.",,12,12
"Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had",,7,12
"In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the",,15,11
"next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for",,8,14
"them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on",,7,14
"her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which",,8,10
"would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive",,9,12
"them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at",,10,11
"least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.",,8,14
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage,,8,12
"before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley",,6,13
"and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very",,9,13
"""I hope, my dear,"" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at",,8,14
"breakfast the next morning, ""that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,",,7,13
"because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""",,6,12
"""Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,",,3,16
"unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners",,5,13
"are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.""",,11,15
"""The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."" Mrs.",,6,13
"Bennet's eyes sparkled.--""A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley",,9,13
I am sure. Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!,,4,15
"Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good",,9,15
"During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants",,8,12
"were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his",,7,12
"guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to",,10,12
"shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady",,9,12
"Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his",,6,12
"comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen",,9,10
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him,,11,12
"to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect",,4,13
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a,,10,14
"person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself",,5,11
"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had",,6,13
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of,,9,12
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and,,9,12
"miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he",,10,12
"had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful",,8,12
"acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had",,4,12
"given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good",,3,13
"deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in",,8,12
"retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected",,12,9
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de,,9,11
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their,,9,13
"aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for",,4,14
"a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach",,9,12
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the,,6,14
"girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,",,9,12
"that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in",,5,13
the house.,,2,2
"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.",,6,13
"Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much",,4,15
"struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he",,9,13
"Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr.",,11,12
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she,,8,10
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.,,5,14
"Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the",,7,14
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The,,5,12
"possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to",,5,11
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be,,13,11
"done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and",,7,15
"throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be",,6,12
otherwise explained.,,4,2
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in,,10,11
"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a",,7,13
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of,,9,13
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that,,9,12
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than,,8,12
"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all",,7,13
"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",,5,13
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the,,8,15
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's,,4,11
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this,,6,11
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his,,8,13
"declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",,4,13
"his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having",,8,12
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the,,10,13
"moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",,7,13
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding,,7,12
"Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon",,9,11
"after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,",,9,9
"""May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",,6,12
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the,,7,14
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his,,4,12
"successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule",,8,11
"to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the",,11,14
"door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she",,5,12
"entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in",,8,11
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins,,7,12
"received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then",,12,10
"proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result",,11,11
"of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the",,10,13
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow,,3,11
"The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and",,4,14
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily,,9,10
"attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.",,6,11
"As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not",,12,11
"by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by",,5,12
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to,,11,11
"her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of",,8,12
"himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose",,9,13
"civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and",,6,13
especially to her friend.,,4,4
"The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the",,11,13
"chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.",,3,15
"Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. ""It keeps him in good",,5,12
"humour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express.""",,5,14
"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and",,7,11
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was,,7,14
"very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth",,10,10
"had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her",,6,13
"from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards",,5,12
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so,,8,11
"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",,7,11
"she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,",,9,12
"when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to",,6,11
"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",,8,11
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the,,8,12
"houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,",,10,11
"but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than",,8,9
"politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always",,9,10
"unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,",,5,6
"""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know",,1,15
